# Exercise 1

You have been asked to manage a basketball league and are going to write a
program to help you. Define two types. The first one, called `Team`, has a field
for the name of the team and a field for the player names. The second type is
called `League` and has a field called `Teams` for the teams in the league and a
field called `Wins` that maps a team's name to its number of wins.
