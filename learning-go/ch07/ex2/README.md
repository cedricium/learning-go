# Exercise 2

Add two methods to `League`. The first method is called `MatchResult`. It takes
four parameters: the name of the first team, its score in the game, the name of
the second team, and its score in the game. This method should update the `Wins`
field in `League`. Add a second method to `League` called `Ranking` that returns
a slice of the team names in order of wins. Build your data structures and call
these methods from the `main` function in your program using some sample data.
